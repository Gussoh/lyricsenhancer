The shepherds had an angel,
The wise men had a star;
But what have I, a little child,
To guide me home from far,
Where glad stars sing together,
And singing angels are?

The Wise Men left their country
To journey morn by morn,
With gold and frankincense and myrrh,
Because the Lord was born:
God sent a star to guide them,
And sent a dream to warn.

My life is like their journey,
Their star is like God's book.
I must be like these good Wise Men,
With heav'n-ward heart and look:
But shall I give no gifts to God?
What precious gifts they took

Lord, I will give my love to Thee,
Than gold much costlier.
Sweeter to Thee than frankincense,
More prized than the choicest myrrh,
Lord, make me dearer day by day,
Day by day holier; (Day by day holier.).

Nearer and dearer day by day,
Till I my voice unite
And sing "Glory, glory"
With angels clad in white;
All "Glory, glory" given to Thee,
All "Glory, glory" given to Thee.

Through all the heav'nly height.
All "Glory, glory."
Through all the heav'nly height.
All "Glory, glory." given to Thee
