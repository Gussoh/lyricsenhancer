I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!

Well, I've never seen a king of beasts with quite so 
little hair.

I'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before.
I'm brushing up on looking down.
I'm working on my roar!

Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing.

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

You've rather a long way to go, young Master! If you 
think...

No one saying "do this,"
Now when I said that I...
No one saying "be there,"
What I meant was that the...
No one saying "stop that,"
But what you don't realize...
No one saying "see here."
Now see here!
Free to run around all day,
Well, that's definitely out.
Free to do it all my way!

I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart-to-
heart.

Kings don't need advice from little horn-bills, for a 
start.

If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa. I wouldn't hang about.
This child is getting wildly out of wing!

Oh I just can't wait to be king!

Everybody look left,
Everybody look right.
Everywhere you look, I'm
Standing spotlight.

Not yet

"Let every creature go for broke and sing.
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing.
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling."

Oh I just can't wait to be king.
Oh I just can't wait to be king.
Oh I just can't wait....
To be king!
