Ariel listen to me the human
World it's mess life under the
Sea is better then anything
They got up there

The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake you
Dream about going up there but
That is a big mistake just look
At the world around you right
Here on the ocean floor such
Wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for

Under the sea  darling it's
Better down where it's wetter
Take it from me up on the shore
They work all day out in the sun
They slave away while we devotin'
Full time to floatin' under the
Sea

Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they
Roll the fish on the land ain't
Happy they sad cause they in
Their bowl but fish in the bowl
Is lucky they in for a worser
Fate one day when the boss get
Hungry guess who's gon' be on
The plate

Under the sea  nobody beat
Us fry us and eat us in fricassee
We what the land folks loves to
Cook under the sea we off the
Hook we got no troubles life is
The bubbles under the sea 
Since life is sweet here we got
The beat here naturally even the
Sturgeon an' the ray they get the
Urge n start to play we got the
Spirit you got to hear it under
The sea

The newt play the flute the carp
Play the harp the plaice play the
Bass and they soundin' sharp the
Bass play the brass the chub play
The tub the fluke is the duke of
Soul (yeah) the ray he can play
The lings on the strings the trout
Rockin' out the blackfish she
Sings the smelt and the sprat they
Know where it's at an' oh that
Blowfish blow

Under the sea  when the
Sardine begin the beguine it's
Music to me what do they got a
Lot of sand we got a hot
Crustacean band each little clam
Here know how to jam here under
The sea each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here under the sea
Each little snail here know how
Ro wail here that's why it's
Hotter under the water ya we in
Luck here down in the muck here
Under the sea
